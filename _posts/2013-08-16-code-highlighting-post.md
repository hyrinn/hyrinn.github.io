I had planned to go on a trip with my best friend since middle school.



### Before Departure 

Before we went on a trip, we decided to match our wallets as a couple and wear similar clothes.

Everyone who saw us probably thought we were twins.





### In the airplane

    


### In Kyoto, Universal Stidio, Osaka




### Souvenirs!!
